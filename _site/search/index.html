						"content": "Crisp Design When designing in Photoshop Illustrator or other programs, make sure you are always locking to pixels and on even numbers. Also make sure the minimum pixel stroke is 2px. Incorrect Correct Good performance Make sure all your layers are compressed into a single layer if they are part of the background. The less layers you have the quicker it will sync and smoother it will run. Keep it on brand When adding a description make sure you are selling the watch and not the features. We handle most of the features in the user interface so you should stay focused on why you made the watch and why the user will want to wear it. For example “This is a watchface any SCI-FI lover will like. Feel like you are in the driver’s seat of a spaceship” Watch face check list Naming Watchfaces Make sure your watchface names are clear and concise. You want to describe your watchface creatively. Don’t add your username, features or any info other than a name for the watchface. Good Example: Time Keeper Bad Example Time Keeper with step counter by Wutronic Description Your description should describe why the user would want to use it. This is all part of the brand, make sure if it’s a sports watchface that you tell people how much it will make them healthier, keep track of goals etc. What you shouldn’t do is list features or leave this blank. Things like features are shown below the description. Also, the longer the description, the more you get the features pushed down below the fold. So, please stick to 2-3 sentences. Keep it short and sweet. Keep it original There is nothing wrong with being inspired by other designs. However it is always good to keep your designs original. Just remaking classics might look ok, but eventually this will cheapen your brand and will be obvious the concepts aren’t original."

						"content": "Good watch face design typically has a few characteristics. They are focused, have a clear hierarchy and have great color harmony. Keep all of those in mind when designing. Watchface Checklist ✓ Do you have a DIM mode? when DIM mode is active it should be either pure black and pure white to display well on all watchfaces. ✓ Dim mode includes the time ✓ Fonts are readable ✓ It has good contrast ✓ All features that are included are working as intended (weather, location, time, step count, battery, etc) ✓ Watchface uses recommended tags like #Db# so that the user can later choose their preference. Design specs Download the starter template Canvas is 640 x 640px at 72 dpi ppi. You might also want to consider that some watches have a chin at the bottom which would hide any design elements that would be down there on selected models. The editor also gives an option to preview the chin with the leftmost button, which is located right below canvas preview Make sure you design for both square and circle and DIM mode. You can do this by clicking advanced button on an image layer and then uploading different images for square and circle."

All elements will be added to the canvas, and it can show you your watch face in different times (using the time machine) &amp; modes. On the canvas you can drag your elements into position, resize, and rotate them. Layer List The layer list contains all layers for your watch. The elements are listed in order from top to bottom as a stack. You can think about it like a stack of paper - elements at the top will cover up the elements below. From here you can drag and drop element's orders, toggle visibility, and rename duplicate delete elements. Time Machine The Facer Time Machine allows you to see your watch face in action. You can use this to preview how your watch will change throughout the day. Use the slider to drag to specific times, or view your watch face animations by using the play &amp; fast-forward buttons. Advanced Panel Every element has an 'advanced' panel, which is where you can add tags, expressions, formulas and more! The advanced section lets you get under the hood and build anything you can dream up in the Facer creator. Shape Previews Shape previews show your watch face as it will appear in various shapes and sizes of watches. In order to get the best exposure for your creations, make sure your watch looks great in both square and round formats, and preview how it will look on watches that have a 'chin' element at the bottom of the dial."

Date This complication provides the date in a readable text format, using the formula #DEEEE#, #DMMMM# #DdL# (Day of Week, Month, Date) as the Text property. Weather Text This complication provides the current temperature in fahrenheit (simulated in the creator), using the formula #WCT##WM# as the Text property. Weather Icons This complication provides a tintable, pre-designed set of icons to show the current weather conditions (simulated in the creator). Hint: Try dragging the time machine slider to see icons for other weather conditions. Battery This complication shows the current battery percentage of your Smartwatch using the #BLP# tag for the Text property.

EXPRESSION IF TEST IS TRUE : EXPRESSION IF TEST IS FALSE $ The first space is for our equality test, which is going to equal true or false. There are five types of operators available: OPERATOR DEFINITION EXAMPLE EXPRESSION EXAMPLE OUTPUT = or == Is equal to (1=1) or (1==1) true != Is not equal to (1!=0) true &gt; Is greater than (2&gt;1) true &lt; Is less than (0&lt;1) true &gt;= Is greater than or equal to (2&gt;=1) true &lt;= Is less than or equal to (0&lt;=1) true Now let's make our own. We'll fill it in step-by-step. Let's start with a blank slate. All of the those dollar signs and question marks look confusing at first, but you'll get used to them (if you have a programming background, you probably already recognize the ternary operator!): $____________?_:_$ Now let's fill in that spot with a simple example. We're going to make an expression that will make a layer appear only before noon. This expression would be added to the opacity attribute of the layer. We'll use the #Da# and check if it's \"AM\": $#Da#==AM?_:_$ Next, we'll fill in the EXPRESSION IF TRUE part of the conditional. When #Da# == \"AM\" is true, we want our layer to appear, so we'll want the opacity to be 1: $#Da#==AM?1:_$ Lastly, we'll fill in the EXPRESSION IF FALSE part of the conditional. When #Da# == \"AM\" is false, we want our layer to disppear, so we'll want the opacity to be 0: $#Da#==AM?1:0$ That's it! You just created your first conditional. Now some advice: Don't use \" marks before and after texts used in conditions. Don't use spaces (\" \") before and after part of conditions (wrong: $ #Da# == AM ? 1 : 0 $ right: $#Da#==AM?1:0$)"

Be sure to check out the Community for more techniques! Width-Based Battery Indicator Bar There are many ways to create a custom battery indicator, but one of the easiest is to use a shape &amp; the width property to show the battery level for a watch or phone. You can inspect this watch face to see it in action and look under the hood! Recipe for Width-Based Battery Indication Property: Width ((#BLN#)*1.55) Rotate Any Element Over Time While we provide essential elements for analog time, you might have an idea that makes a second minute hour hand out of a different element altogether (rotating text, shape, cat with laser eyes, etc). This recipe will show you how to rotate any element based on the time. For our example we use 'seconds': #DWFSS#, but you could also use a different tag. You can inspect this watch face to see it in action on a shape element! Recipe for Rotating With Seconds Property: Rotation #DWFSS# Back &amp; Forth Motion You can use the sine &amp; cosine functions to make back &amp; forth movement, as demonstrated by this laser cat's tongue: You can inspect this watch face to see it in action and look under the hood! Recipe for Back &amp; Forth Motion Property: Y Position (219 + sin((#DWFSS#))*10)"

						"content": "In order to help advanced users with a series of samples of possibilities, we've created the 'Kitchen Sink' watch face. This watch face isn't very useful for telling time, but you can use Inspection Mode to see how we achieve certain animations and effects here at Facer HQ. You can open the watch in inspector mode to see how it all works: https: www.facer.io watchface 1WkGlWDQzf inspect Feel free to make changes, nothing will get saved so you're free to play! We'll go through a couple of specific expressions used in the watch face: Fade In Fade Out These recipes cover 3 behaviors: Fade in when the watch wakes up, Fade out when the watch wakes up, or Fade In Out on a loop. Note: To see the fade in &amp; fade out elements in our sample, you'll need to toggle between Active Dim mode while the time machine is running at normal speed. Recipe for Fade In When the Watch Wakes: Property: Transparency ((interpAccel(#DWE#, 0, 2, 2)*100)) Recipe for Fade Out When the Watch Wakes: Property: Transparency (100-(interpAccel(#DWE#, 0, 2, 2)*100)) Recipe for Looping Fade In &amp; Fade Out: Property: Transparency ((sin(#DWE#*5))*50+50) Pendulum Motion Allow an element to move as if swinging from a string Recipe for Pendulum Motion: Property: Rotation (sin(#DWE#*2)*50) \"Breathing\" Motion Have an element cycle properties easing in &amp; out, to create a 'breathing' effect Recipe for Breathing Opacity: Property: Transparency ((sin(#DWE#*2)*60)+50) Recipe for Breathing Size: Property: Radius ((sin(#DWE#*2)*40)+50) Basic Orbit Orbit an element in a circular motion Recipe for Basic Orbit: Property: X Position (160 + sin(#DWFSS# 4)*50) Property: Y Position (160 + cos(#DWFSS# 4)*50)"
