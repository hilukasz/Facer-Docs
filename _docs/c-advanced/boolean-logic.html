<p>For the ultra adventurous, the EQUALITY TEST portion of a Facer conditional also <strong>supports a maximum of 3 basic Boolean operators in any given formula</strong>. (Basic boolean operators are <code>||</code> and <code>&amp;&amp;</code>). Have fun!</p>
<p>
A note about boolean operators in conditionals, it's important to avoid putting parentheses around equality and boolean expressions. Here are some examples:
</p>
<p>
These will be ok:
</p>
<p>
<code class="good">$ 1 == 1 || 1 == 1 ? 1 : 0 $ </code><br/><br/>

<code class="good">$ (1+1) == (1) || (1) == (1) ? 1 : 0 $</code>
</p>
<p>These will have unexpected results:</p>

<p><code class="bad">$ (1 == 1) || (1 == 1) ? 1 : 0 $ </code><br/><br/>

<code class="bad">$ (1 == 1 || 1 == 1) ? 1 : 0 $</code></p>
